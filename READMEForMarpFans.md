# SimoRBLX's PUBLIC java weather code.
## Quick Read Note/s:

* Read the LICENSE file, or at the very least, read the first comments of the Java files.
* Any dependency required to run the code is pre installed, so if you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you should be good to go, without even needing to install any other sub-module.
* Any dependency is installed inside the `OpenSourceWeather_Project\MainProject\REQUIREMENTSFORPROJECT\` directory.
* You'll need to install Java (JDK) 19.0.1 yourself, either by your [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or by [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java19)

My comments *__MIGHT__* just look like that
```java
    public Class Fart
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            // prints fard
            System.out.println("Fart");
        }
    }
```
