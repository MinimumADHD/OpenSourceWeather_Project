# SimoRBLX's PUBLIC java weather code.
## Quick Read Note/s:

* Read the LICENSE file, or at the very least, read the first comments of the Java files.
* Any dependency required to run the code is pre installed, so if you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you should be good to go, without even needing to install any other sub-module.
* Any dependency is installed inside the `OpenSourceWeather_Project\MainProject\REQUIREMENTSFORPROJECT\` directory.
* You'll need to install Java (JDK) 19.0.1 yourself, either by your [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or by [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java19)
* The code you will find **IS STILL INCOMPLETE**, when completed, a Release will pop out in the `Releases` tab.

### In this project you can find:

* Comments to help you understand (the presence of comments variates depending on my ADHD hitting or not.)
* Basic and understandable Java code for 3rd graders with a very basic functional brain.
